# AGENTS.md — SmartTutor Project Brain Rules

- Use PRD.md as source of truth; do not change requirements unless asked.
- Create/maintain PLANS.md as execution plan with milestones and acceptance criteria.
- Keep diagram / text based question / equation rendering deterministic; LLM outputs structured specs only.
- MVP scope is only Geometry → Triangles (Grade 6) up to Pythagoras.
- Prefer small, incremental changes; avoid refactors unless required.
- Every milestone must include: files touched+ manual test steps.
